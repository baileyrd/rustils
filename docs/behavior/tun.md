# Behavior Spec — tun (Tun, TunDevice)

RFC v2 R5+, decision D14. Single named consumer: rusty_tail's `ts-tun`
(`ts-tun/src/{lib,sys}.rs`), which hand-rolls `/dev/net/tun` +
`TUNSETIFF` + the `SIOCSIFADDR`/`SIOCSIFNETMASK`/`SIOCSIFMTU`/
`SIOCGIFFLAGS`/`SIOCSIFFLAGS` configuration dance directly against
`libc`. `Tun::create(name, ipv4, prefix_len, mtu)` mirrors that exact
shape — creation, addressing, MTU, and bring-up bundled into one call
— because that is the whole of what the named consumer does; there is
no finer-grained decomposition (bare create without addressing,
address-only reconfiguration of an already-created device) anyone has
asked for.

Live-verified on Linux (`crates/platform-linux/tests/tun_parity.rs`):
this sandboxed environment genuinely has `/dev/net/tun` and
`CAP_NET_ADMIN`, so the parity suite exercises real kernel interaction
— an actually-created interface, a real installed route, a real
kernel-routed outbound packet, and a hand-crafted (independently
checksummed) inbound packet actually delivered to a bound `UdpSocket`
— not merely "the ioctls returned `Ok`". Each test claims its own
`/24` under CGNAT space (100.64.0.0/10, the same convention `ts-tun`'s
own doc comment uses) rather than sharing one, because `cargo test`
runs test functions on parallel threads by default and two tests
racing for the same subnet's route is a real bug (a blocking `read()`
on the "losing" interface hangs forever waiting for a packet the
kernel delivered to the other test's device instead), not a
theoretical one — it was hit and fixed during development.

## Specified

- `Tun::create` opens a new TUN (not TAP — no consumer needs an
  Ethernet-framed link) device, assigns `ipv4`/`prefix_len` to it,
  which on Linux also installs the connected route for that subnet (no
  explicit route command needed), sets the interface MTU to `mtu`,
  and brings the interface administratively up before returning.
- The returned `TunDevice::name()` is the OS-assigned interface name —
  ordinarily equal to the requested `name`, but callers must not assume
  equality: a platform's own interface-name length limit could force
  truncation.
- `TunDevice::read` blocks until the kernel has routed an outbound IP
  packet into the tunnel, then returns it verbatim (the whole IP
  packet, header included — this is a layer-3 device, not a
  socket-level payload API).
- `TunDevice::write` injects `buf` as an inbound IP packet: the local
  network stack processes it exactly as if it had arrived over a real
  wire, including delivering UDP/TCP payloads to a socket bound to the
  packet's destination address and port.
- `create` requires elevated privilege (`CAP_NET_ADMIN` on Linux) and
  is a real `Err` (not a panic) when the caller lacks it.
- The concrete Linux device type (`platform_linux::LinuxTunDevice`)
  additionally provides `AsFd`/`AsRawFd`/`set_nonblocking` on the
  concrete (non-boxed) type — the same raw-fd escape hatch
  rustils#41/#42 established for `Net`, for the same reason: `ts-tun`,
  like `ts-magicsock` before it, needs to register the device's fd
  with tokio's own reactor and drive I/O directly, not through this
  trait's blocking calls.

## Deliberately unspecified

- Windows (`wintun`): no backend exists.
  `platform_windows::WindowsTun::create` always returns
  `ErrorKind::Unsupported` — explicitly, rather than the module being
  absent — because `ts-tun` (the only named consumer for this
  surface) is `#![cfg(target_os = "linux")]` only, so there is no
  donor evidence for what a Windows shape should even look like. This
  is the same judgment call `Sandbox` already makes for macOS/Windows
  confinement: no invented design without a consumer to validate it
  against.
- macOS: no backend at all (not even an `Unsupported` stub) — the
  same "no consumer, no speculative surface" call; nothing currently
  imports `platform-macos`'s crate expecting a `Tun` impl to exist.
- TAP (Ethernet-framed) devices, multi-queue TUN, `IFF_NO_PI` toggling
  as a caller-visible option (this backend always requests
  `IFF_NO_PI`, matching `ts-tun`), IPv6 addressing, and any routing
  beyond the single connected route `ipv4`/`prefix_len` installs —
  none of these have a named consumer.
- `platform-mock`'s `MockTun`/`MockTunDevice`: does not simulate
  kernel routing at all — there is no "other side" within one process
  the way `MockUdpSocket`/`MockTcpStream` simulate a peer socket, since
  a TUN device's real counterpart is the kernel's own routing table,
  not another endpoint this crate could stand up. Instead it is
  scriptable: a test queues raw bytes for a future `read()` via
  `MockTunDevice::queue_inbound`, and every `write()` call is recorded
  for `written_packets()` to assert against. It also does not block —
  `read()` on an empty queue returns `Ok(0)` immediately rather than
  waiting, the same "no real mechanism to block on" tradeoff
  `MockCsprng` makes for randomness quality.
