# Behavior Spec — net (Net / TcpStream / TcpListener / UdpSocket)

The parity suite (`crates/platform-linux/tests/net_parity.rs`,
`crates/platform-windows/tests/net_parity.rs`, and (net-only, rustils#48)
`crates/platform-macos/tests/net_parity.rs`, all three kept textually
identical — the same convention `parity.rs` established) asserts this
spec against every backend. A backend that cannot honor a line gets a
numbered entry in `../divergences.md` citing the OS limitation — never
implementation convenience.

`platform-macos` (landed rustils#48, forced by `rusty_tokio`'s
hand-rolled macOS/BSD socket lifecycle duplicating what this trait
already solved for Linux) implements exactly this spec with no
behavioral divergence from it — every difference from
`platform-linux`'s implementation (no `SOCK_CLOEXEC`/`SOCK_NONBLOCK`/
`accept4`, an extra `sin_len`-style sockaddr field) is mechanism-only,
invisible at this trait's boundary, so it earns no entry in
`../divergences.md`. `platform-macos` is `fs`/`process`/`security`/
`term`/`signals`-free — a deliberately net-only slice; those surfaces
follow only if a consumer forces them, the same RFC v2 §3 discipline
every other surface in this workspace already follows. Not yet run on
real hardware by this workspace's own CI (no macOS runner today) —
validated so far via `cargo check`/`clippy --target
x86_64-apple-darwin`, mirroring how `platform-windows` was originally
developed from a Linux host.

## Scope (all three D16 slices — TCP, Unix domain sockets, UDP)

RFC v2 R5+, decision D16. Four named consumers (shh, rusty_tail,
rusty_rdp, rusty_llama's optional server) define this domain's shape, and
none of them need TLS in the trait — all four bring their own wire crypto
or inject TLS separately, so `Net`/`TcpStream`/`TcpListener`/`UdpSocket`
carry no TLS concept at all. The TCP slice covers
connect/listen/accept/`set_nodelay`.

Unix domain stream sockets rode along as a follow-on slice:
`Net::unix_connect`/`unix_listen`, `UnixStream`, `UnixListener`,
mirroring `TcpStream`/`TcpListener`'s shape with `PathBuf` addresses in
place of `SocketAddr`, minus `set_nodelay` (no Nagle buffering on
`AF_UNIX` to toggle) and with mode-bit narrowing + stale-cleanup bind
semantics on `unix_listen` that `tcp_listen` has no analog for.
LocalAPI/agent-socket consumers (rusty_tail, shh) are the named shape
for this half of the slice.

UDP datagram sockets are the third and final D16 slice:
`Net::udp_bind`, `UdpSocket`, named for rusty_tail's magicsock
transport. Unlike TCP and Unix streams, UDP has no listener/stream
split — one connectionless socket both sends and receives, addressed
per call — and no handshake to fail, the biggest behavioral departure
from the other two slices (see below).

## Specified

- `Net::tcp_connect(addr)` opens a TCP connection to `addr`. Nothing
  listening (or a listener that has since dropped) fails
  `ConnectionRefused`, never hangs.
- `Net::tcp_listen(addr)` binds and starts listening at `addr`. A second
  `tcp_listen` on an address already bound by a live listener in the same
  process fails `AddrInUse`; dropping the first listener frees the
  address for reuse.
- `TcpListener::accept()` blocks until a peer connects, returning the new
  `TcpStream` and the peer's address.
- `TcpStream::read`/`write` are byte-faithful, ordinary blocking I/O — no
  framing, no encoding. A dropped peer is observed as a `read` returning
  `Ok(0)` (end of stream), not an error.
- `TcpStream::set_nodelay` toggles Nagle's algorithm; the call itself
  always succeeds when the stream is valid — the underlying OS-level
  meaning of the flag is not asserted here.
- `TcpStream::peer_addr`/`local_addr` and `TcpListener::local_addr`
  report the real (possibly OS-assigned ephemeral) socket address.
  `tcp_listen` on port `0` gets a real ephemeral port; `local_addr` after
  `listen` never reports port `0`.
- `TcpStream: Send` and `TcpListener: Send` (unlike `Dir`/`Child`, which
  don't cross threads in this codebase): the standard "accept on one
  thread, hand the connection to a worker thread" server pattern is the
  entire reason this surface exists, per the roadmap, so both are
  required to be movable across threads by the trait itself, not left to
  each backend to happen to get right.
- `TcpStream::set_read_timeout(Some(d))` bounds how long a `read` will
  block waiting for data — an idle timeout, not a per-call deadline
  (each `read` gets its own fresh `d`). `None` blocks indefinitely, the
  default before this is ever called. A timeout expiring surfaces as
  `ErrorKind::WouldBlock` **or** `ErrorKind::TimedOut` — deliberately
  not pinned to one, the same ambiguity
  `std::net::TcpStream::set_read_timeout` itself documents (Linux's
  `SO_RCVTIMEO` expiring is `EAGAIN`, indistinguishable from a
  genuinely non-blocking socket at the errno level) — every real caller
  already has to check both. Added after the TCP/Unix/UDP slices
  landed, forced by a real gap: rusty_rdp's convergence needs it
  (`examples/connect.rs` idles a read loop out via
  `std::net::TcpStream::set_read_timeout`), not speculation.

### Unix domain sockets

- `Net::unix_connect(path)` connects to the Unix domain socket bound at
  `path`. A path with a live listener succeeds; a path that still names
  a real (if stale — see stale-cleanup bind semantics below) socket file
  but has nothing accepting on it fails `ConnectionRefused`, mirroring
  `tcp_connect`'s "nothing listening" case, never hangs.
- `Net::unix_listen(path)` binds and starts listening at `path`. A
  `path` already bound by a live listener — in this process or another —
  fails `AddrInUse`. A path left behind by a listener that died without
  unlinking it is reclaimed automatically instead: the kernel/Winsock
  `bind` call alone can't distinguish "a live listener still owns this
  path" from "a stale file is sitting here" (both report the identical
  collision), so `unix_listen` resolves the ambiguity itself with a
  throwaway probe connect — refused means stale, so the leftover file is
  unlinked and the bind retried exactly once; a successful probe means a
  live listener owns it, left untouched, `AddrInUse` surfaces as normal.
  Callers never need to unlink a path themselves. Unlike `tcp_listen`'s
  port `0`, there is no ephemeral-path equivalent.
- `UnixListener::accept()` blocks until a peer connects, returning the
  new `UnixStream` and the peer's bound path, or `None` when the peer
  connected from an unnamed (anonymous) `AF_UNIX` socket — a legal state
  with no TCP equivalent.
- `UnixStream::read`/`write` are byte-faithful, ordinary blocking I/O,
  exactly like `TcpStream`'s — no framing, no encoding. A dropped peer
  is observed as `read` returning `Ok(0)`, not an error.
- `UnixStream::peer_addr`/`local_addr` and `UnixListener::local_addr`
  return `Option<PathBuf>` rather than a bare `PathBuf`: `None` covers
  the unnamed-socket case above, since `AF_UNIX` (unlike TCP) permits a
  connected or even listening socket with no path bound to it.
- Mode bits: on a backend with a POSIX mode-bit model, `unix_listen`
  narrows the just-bound socket file to `0600` (owner read/write only)
  immediately after `bind`, rather than leaving it at whatever the
  process umask allows — the shape the LocalAPI/agent consumers
  (rusty_tail, shh) asked for. A backend with no POSIX-chmod equivalent
  for an `AF_UNIX` bind (Windows) has no narrowing step to perform and
  leaves the bound file at the filesystem's own ACL defaults instead;
  `unix_listen` still succeeds there — a registered divergence
  (`../divergences.md` #007), the same shape as the existing `unix_mode`
  divergence (#006).
- Error mapping mirrors `tcp_connect`/`tcp_listen`'s kinds wherever the
  underlying condition is the same: a bind collision (live or stale
  path) maps to `AddrInUse`; connecting to a socket file that exists but
  has nothing accepting maps to `ConnectionRefused`; a path the caller
  lacks permission to bind or connect to maps to `PermissionDenied`.
  These three are what each backend's own errno/WSA-code table already
  maps today, and the shared parity suite (`assert_unix_behavior`)
  pins `ConnectionRefused` and the stale-cleanup-bind path across every
  backend.
- `UnixStream: Send` and `UnixListener: Send`, for the identical
  accept-on-one-thread/hand-off-to-a-worker-thread reason
  `TcpStream`/`TcpListener` are.
- No `set_nodelay` counterpart on `UnixStream`: `TCP_NODELAY` disables
  Nagle's algorithm, which only exists on TCP's byte stream over a
  network — `AF_UNIX` sockets are a local, in-kernel byte pipe with no
  Nagle buffering to toggle.

### UDP datagram sockets

- `Net::udp_bind(addr)` binds a UDP socket at `addr` (port `0` picks a
  real ephemeral port, same as `tcp_listen`). No `listen`/`accept`: a
  bound `UdpSocket` immediately both sends and receives.
- `UdpSocket::send_to(buf, addr)` sends `buf` as one datagram to `addr`.
  **Fire-and-forget**: unlike `tcp_connect`/`unix_connect`, there is no
  handshake to fail — sending to an address nothing is bound to (or
  whose socket has since closed) succeeds exactly like sending to a
  live one; UDP gives no synchronous signal either way. This is the
  single biggest behavioral departure from the TCP/Unix slices above.
- `UdpSocket::recv_from(buf)` blocks until one datagram arrives,
  returning its length and the sender's address. A datagram larger
  than `buf` is truncated to `buf`'s length (matching
  `recvfrom(2)`/`WSARecvFrom`'s own `SOCK_DGRAM` truncation behavior)
  — not detected or reported, since the OS gives no signal
  distinguishing "exactly `buf.len()` bytes arrived" from "more arrived
  and got truncated."
- `UdpSocket::local_addr()` reports the real (possibly OS-assigned
  ephemeral) bound address, the same contract as
  `TcpListener::local_addr`.
- A second `udp_bind` on an address already bound in the same process
  fails `AddrInUse`; dropping the first socket frees the address for
  reuse — the same contract as `tcp_listen`'s bind collision, despite
  `send_to` having none.
- `UdpSocket: Send`, for the identical reason every other socket type
  here is: rusty_tail's magicsock (the named consumer) runs its send
  and receive loops on separate threads.
- TCP, Unix, and UDP bind spaces are independent: binding the same port
  number for TCP and UDP (or the same numeric value as a Unix socket
  path is never possible, since paths and ports aren't the same
  namespace to begin with) never collides — pinned by a dedicated mock
  test (`udp_bind_port_zero_and_tcp_listen_port_zero_can_collide_by_number`)
  rather than the shared parity suite, since it is a cross-domain
  assertion rather than a per-backend behavior.

## Deliberately unspecified

- Any TLS/crypto behavior — out of scope for this trait by design (see
  Scope above); consumers layer their own wire security over the plain
  `TcpStream`. The full design research on why this stays true — and
  which one narrow piece (OS trust-anchor access) could ever land
  elsewhere in the PAL under §3's gate — is
  `../design-discussion-tls.md` (rustils#70).
- The exact `ErrorKind` `unix_connect` reports for a `path` that never
  named any socket file at all, as opposed to a stale-but-present one —
  asserted only as "fails, not hangs," not pinned to one `ErrorKind`
  across backends, since each backend's own errno/WSA-code table is
  free to draw that "nothing there" vs. "something there but not
  listening" line differently.
- The effective access control on a `unix_listen` socket file for a
  backend with no POSIX-chmod equivalent to narrow it with — that
  backend's own filesystem ACL defaults govern, not this trait.
- Whether the socket file a listener bound to is removed when the
  `UnixListener` is dropped or its owning process dies without explicit
  cleanup — not this trait's concern either way; `unix_listen`'s
  stale-cleanup bind already makes a leftover path self-healing on the
  next `unix_listen` regardless of how it was left behind.
- Exact OS-level effect of `set_nodelay(false)` re-enabling Nagle's
  algorithm — asserted only as "the call does not error," not as an
  observable timing behavior, since that would make the parity suite
  flaky.
- Backlog size, accept queue behavior under load, and other OS-tunable
  socket options beyond `SO_REUSEADDR` (used internally by `tcp_listen`)
  and `TCP_NODELAY`.
- Maximum practical datagram size, MTU, and fragmentation behavior for
  `UdpSocket::send_to`/`recv_from` — asserted only as "a datagram too
  large to send in one piece is a genuine local error," not pinned to a
  specific size, since that varies by OS, address family, and path MTU
  in ways no named consumer has asked this trait to abstract over.
- Whether IPv4/IPv6 UDP sockets are independently bound (dual-stack
  behavior) — every backend here binds the address family `addr`
  itself names, with no dual-stack `IPV6_V6ONLY` handling either way;
  not exercised by the parity suite, which only uses IPv4 loopback.
- `UnixStream`/`UdpSocket` have no `set_read_timeout` counterpart —
  only `TcpStream` needed one for its actual forcing consumer
  (rusty_rdp), and this trait doesn't speculatively grow surface no
  named consumer has asked for (RFC v2 §3). Add it there too if and
  when something actually needs it.
