//! Terminal surface — the D9 cluster (extraction map, second wave;
//! architecture.md Layer 2). Five donors independently hand-rolled this
//! personality — rusty_libc's termios/tty, rusty_win32's console modes,
//! rush's isatty plumbing, rusty_lines' `term_sys` facade, and shh's
//! `tty/{unix,windows}` — the strongest consumer-gate evidence any
//! surface in this project has had (§3; named consumers: rusty_naner,
//! rush interactive, rusty_lines' host, shh, and `rterm` here as the
//! reference consumer).
//!
//! **Design oracle: `rusty_term`.** Its `backend::{Backend,
//! BackendHandle}` pair is a full terminal emulator's OS slice, already
//! factored as a portable trait over two per-OS unsafe files and
//! CI-proven on both OSes — richer evidence than any single donor above.
//! This trait is built fresh from its *semantics*, not linked to it: its
//! backend pulls in tokio and an edition-2024 MSRV, which would invert
//! the layer stack (Layer 2 depending on a Layer 3 tool's async
//! runtime) and blow past this workspace's 1.75 floor. `rusty_term`
//! converges later by swapping its backend internals for this trait.
//! Two lessons it teaches that the earlier three-donor sketch missed:
//! raw mode on Windows touches **two streams** (stdin input modes *and*
//! stdout VT-processing — see [`Terminal::enter_raw`]'s Windows arm),
//! and the save/restore lifecycle (not a bare toggle) is the actual
//! contract — both are reflected in this trait's shape.
//!
//! Slice 1 is the portable core the donors agree on: per-stream tty
//! detection, window size, and raw mode. Slice 2 (convergence roadmap
//! Phase 2, forced by rusty_lines' `term_sys` facade) adds the input
//! side a line editor needs: a live [`Terminal::is_raw`] probe,
//! [`Terminal::poll_readable`]/[`Terminal::read_chunk`] for batched,
//! non-per-byte input, and [`Terminal::set_echo`] for a password-prompt
//! style echo toggle independent of full raw mode.
//!
//! **Two facets rusty_lines has that deliberately get no new surface**
//! here, because they need none: bracketed paste is protocol bytes over
//! the stream the consumer already reads via [`read_chunk`](
//! Terminal::read_chunk) — no OS call is involved, so it stays
//! expressible by the consumer rather than owned here (the same
//! discipline this project applies to shell policy). Cooked↔raw
//! suspend/resume (the `$EDITOR`-handoff shape) is exactly
//! [`enter_raw`](Terminal::enter_raw)/[`leave_raw`](Terminal::leave_raw)
//! called a second time — their save/restore contract already covers
//! it; naming a separate pair would duplicate, not extend, the surface.
//!
//! Several other real, larger facets are deliberately deferred to later
//! slices, each entering only when a consumer forces it (§3): Unix
//! job-control handoff (`tcsetpgrp`, SIGTSTP/SIGCONT — no portable
//! twin); PTY hosting (D13 — a distinct Process×Terminal surface, not
//! folded into raw-mode/winsize); resize *notification* (a genuine
//! divergence `rusty_term` proves: a SIGWINCH stream on Unix vs no
//! Windows equivalent, so Windows consumers poll — `behavior/term.md`
//! records it); byte→key decode (keymap policy, stays with the
//! consumer); and console *acquisition* for GUI-subsystem processes
//! (attach/alloc/redirect — from rusty_naner, a separate facet from
//! raw-mode on an already-inherited console).
//!
//! Raw mode is **stateful and process-visible** (termios flags /
//! console modes): [`Terminal::enter_raw`] saves the previous state and
//! [`Terminal::leave_raw`] restores exactly it. Consumers own the
//! enter/leave pairing (RAII belongs to the consumer's guard, not this
//! object-safe trait — same division as the donors').
