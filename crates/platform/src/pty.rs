//! PTY surface (RFC v2 R5+, decision D13, convergence roadmap Phase 7) — a
//! Process×Terminal capability, built without a confirmed live consumer on
//! the owner's explicit call (the same posture `security::CredentialStore`
//! and `security::Sandbox`'s confinement half were built under). See
//! `docs/design-discussion-pty.md` for the full donor-shape reconciliation
//! this trait's shape is drawn from.
//!
//! **One atomic [`Pty::spawn`], not a separate open/attach pair.** Windows's
//! ConPTY structurally cannot attach an already-created pseudo console to
//! an already-running, separately-spawned process — the pseudo console is
//! only ever wired to a child at `CreateProcessW` time. Offering a Unix-only
//! "open a pty, attach a process to it later" pair would leave the attach
//! step permanently `Unsupported` on Windows, so this trait doesn't offer
//! it: opening the pty and spawning the child are one call on every
//! backend. [`Command`]'s existing `argv`/`cwd`/`env` fields apply
//! unchanged; `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` are moot (the pty slave is all
//! three, so backends ignore whatever those fields hold) and
//! [`GroupSpec::JoinGroup`](crate::process::GroupSpec::JoinGroup) is
//! rejected outright — see [`Pty::spawn`]'s own doc for why.
//!
//! **`Ok(0)` at EOF**, matching [`crate::fs::File`]/
//! [`crate::term::Terminal::read_chunk`]'s existing convention — not a raw
//! errno, not an OS-specific sentinel. Unix's `EIO`-on-slave-close and
//! Windows's broken-pipe-on-child-exit both collapse to this one signal.
//!
//! **Resize** reuses [`crate::term::WinSize`] rather than inventing a
//! parallel size type.
//!
//! Deliberately out of scope: macOS (no donor evidence — D13 only surveys
//! shh/rusty_term, both Linux+Windows), job-control terminal handoff
//! (already [`crate::term::JobControl`], D9 — a consumer composes the two),
//! and resize *notification* (an already-deferred `term` facet, D9).
