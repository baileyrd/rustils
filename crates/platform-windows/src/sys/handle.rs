// SAFETY: a Win32 HANDLE is an opaque, thread-affinity-free value — the
// underlying OS object doesn't care which thread issues calls against
// it, and concurrent use of the *same* open handle from multiple
// threads (e.g. one thread's `ReadFile` racing another's, or a
// background watcher thread waiting on a handle another thread also
// holds — `sys::pty::spawn_exit_watcher`'s own reason for needing this)
// is a documented-safe, common Windows pattern. `w::HANDLE` is a raw
// pointer type, which is `!Send`/`!Sync` by default only because the
// compiler can't know that about an arbitrary pointer — this type's own
// single-owner, close-once-on-drop contract (this module's own doc
// comment) isn't weakened by letting that owner live on a different
// thread than the one that created it, or by sharing `&OwnedWinHandle`
// across threads (no interior mutability here for a second thread to
// observe torn).
