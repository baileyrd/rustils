//! ConPTY primitives (RFC v2 R5+, D13, convergence roadmap Phase 7,
//! rustils#83, part 2/2 following #82's Linux backend): pseudo console
//! creation, spawning attached to it, resize, and drain-before-close
//! teardown.
//!
//! **Attach happens only at `CreateProcessW` time.** Unlike Unix, there
//! is no Win32 call to attach an already-created pseudo console to an
//! already-running process — `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PSEUDOCONSOLE` only
//! exists as a `STARTUPINFOEXW` attribute passed to `CreateProcessW`
//! itself. See `docs/design-discussion-pty.md`'s "shape question"
//! section for why `platform::pty::Pty::spawn` is one atomic operation
//! rather than separable open/attach steps.
//!
//! **Two separate handles, not one fd.** ConPTY's master side is a pair
//! of anonymous pipes — an input pipe the master writes to, an output
//! pipe the master reads from — not a single bidirectional descriptor
//! the way a Unix pty master fd is. `WindowsPtyMaster` (crate root)
//! holds both; there is no honest single-handle `AsHandle`/`AsRawHandle`
//! impl to offer the way `LinuxPtyMaster`'s `AsFd`/`AsRawFd` does, so it
//! isn't attempted — two named accessors instead (see that type's own
//! doc comment).
//!
//! **`ClosePseudoConsole` can deadlock against an un-drained output
//! pipe.** It blocks until conhost's internal writer thread finishes,
//! which can itself be blocked writing into a full pipe nobody is
//! reading — the EOF-vs-exit teardown lesson D13 already flagged.
//! [`close`] drains the output pipe with a bounded, non-blocking
//! `PeekNamedPipe` loop before calling `ClosePseudoConsole`.
//!
//! **ConPTY does not spontaneously EOF when the child exits** — unlike
//! a Unix pty slave, which the kernel closes automatically once its
//! last holder exits. [`spawn_exit_watcher`] is the one place this
//! module does need a background thread: it watches the child and
//! forces `ClosePseudoConsole` once it exits, so `PtyMaster::read`'s own
//! documented `Ok(0)`-on-child-exit contract holds on Windows too, not
//! just Unix. Unlike [`close`], it does *not* drain the output pipe
//! first — see its own doc comment for why draining there raced (and
//! lost real output to) a caller's own concurrent reads, and the
//! shared-close guard against `WindowsPtyMaster::drop` also reaching
//! `ClosePseudoConsole`.

/// `ClosePseudoConsole` instead (see its own doc comment for why
/// draining there raced a caller's own concurrent reads). `Drop`'s case
/// is different: the caller has already decided to stop reading
/// (dropping the master), so there's no concurrent reader left to race,
/// and draining first is what keeps this `ClosePseudoConsole` call from
/// deadlocking against conhost's writer if the caller never emptied the
/// pipe (`dropping_an_undrained_master_does_not_deadlock`).
