//! Live PTY test (rustils#83): spawns real children attached to a real
//! ConPTY pseudo console, no mock — the same live-verification bar #82's
//! Linux backend was held to. Only actually executes on CI's
//! `windows-latest` leg; this crate's whole backend is developed from a
//! Linux host against `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
//! (`crates/platform-windows/src/lib.rs`'s own module doc), so nothing
//! here has run outside CI.
//!
//! **Every blocking call in this file is bounded.** A first version of
//! this test used the portable `Pty`/`PtyMaster`/`Child` trait objects
//! directly, with unbounded `master.read()`/`child.wait()` calls — and a
//! genuine hang in that first ConPTY implementation attempt (caught
//! *because* of this) turned a ~1-minute CI job into a 45+ minute stuck
//! run that had to be cancelled by hand, with no diagnostic signal at
//! all about which call was stuck. Testing at the `sys::pty` level
//! instead (rather than through the type-erased `Box<dyn PtyMaster>`,
//! which has no way to reach the raw handles a bounded read needs)
//! gives every read a `wait_readable` budget and every wait a
//! `try_wait` poll budget — a real hang now fails the specific test
//! with a clear message inside `READ_BUDGET`/`WAIT_BUDGET`, not an
//! opaque multi-minute CI stall.
